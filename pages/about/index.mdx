# About

Hello All!

We are [Caroline Sinders](https://carolinesinders.com/) and [Natalie Cadranel](https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/person/natalie-cadranel/). Caroline is an artist and design researcher looking at how the product design and UX design of technology and software can have unintended consequences in society. Natalie, founder and executive director of [OpenArchive](https://open-archive.org/), is an archivist and ethnographer working at the nexus of human rights, design, and technology. Together, with funding from [NDI](https://www.ndi.org/) and the [Open Technology Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/), we are creating an online, open source curriculum focusing on security and privacy in design. It’s called the Secure UX Curriculum that builds out an accessible, teachable methodology based on the [Secure UX Checklist](https://humanrightscentered.design/s/Secure-UX-Checklist.pdf) created by a variety of researchers, activists, designers and security experts: Sage Cheng, Natalie Cadranel, An Xiao Mina, and Martin Shelton, with generous contributions from Caroline Sinders, Matt Mitchell, Soraya Okuda, TTCat, and Max Anderson. 

## Contributors

**Natalie Cadranel** is an archivist and ethnographer working at the nexus of human rights, design, and technology. She is the Founder and Executive Director of [OpenArchive](https://open-archive.org/), an experienced research and development organization dedicated to the ethical collection and long-term preservation of mobile media. Using participatory research methods and co-design, she created ‘Save’, a free, open source, mobile-to-archive preservation ecosystem, which ethically collects and preserves media captured by groups at risk of persecution and censorship. OpenArchive seeks to protect its communities  – and their media – from efforts to chill free speech through content takedowns, privacy breaches, and data loss, while preserving it for legacy access.

Natalie complements her work with a strong theoretical background, having earned a Masters of Information Management and Systems from UC Berkeley’s School of Information in 2013. She was a 2019 Stanford PACS’ Digital Civil Society Lab fellow and currently serves on the board of Common Frequency.

**Caroline Sinders** is an award winning critical designer, researcher, and artist. For the past few years, she has been examining the intersections of artificial intelligence, intersectional justice, systems design, harm, and politics in digital conversational spaces and technology platforms. She has worked with the United Nations, Amnesty International, IBM Watson, the Wikimedia Foundation, and others. Sinders has held fellowships with the Harvard Kennedy School, Google’s PAIR (People and Artificial Intelligence Research group), Ars Electronica’s AI Lab, the Weizenbaum Institute, the Mozilla Foundation, Pioneer Works, Eyebeam, Ars Electronica, the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, the Sci Art Resonances program with the European Commission, and the International Center of Photography. Her work has been featured in the Tate Exchange in Tate Modern, the Contemporary Art Center of New Orleans, Telematic Media Arts, Victoria and Albert Museum, MoMA PS1, LABoral, Wired, Slate, Hyperallergic, Clot Magazine, Quartz, the Channels Festival, and others. Sinders holds a Masters from New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program.

**Darren Clarke** is a full-stack developer living in Berlin. He works with civil society groups to counter disinformation and censorship and to promote digital security and privacy.

**Vani Chitkara** is a web developer, UI and graphics designer, and an aspiring software developer. She has interned with Microsoft as Software Engineer Intern and with OpenArchive as a communication team intern through the Outreachy open source internship program. She is an active member of several tech communities. She has led the Google Developer Student Club at her university and has volunteered at several initiatives that support and uplift the women in tech. She has been a student fellow at the Reboot Student Fellowship-a fellowship based on the intersection of tech, humanity, and power. Her interests lie in technology, reading, and writing.

**Amira Dhalla** has spent over a decade in technology working on issues related to digital rights, privacy, and equity with global organizations and communities. Together, she works with educators and activists to design participatory curriculum and resources to make emerging technology more inclusive, open, and safe. She currently works at Consumer Reports as the Director of Impact Partnerships with a focus on digital rights and security.

**Roxy Zeiher** is a graphic designer living and working between Berlin, London and Zurich. Particularly interested in critical and contemporary subject areas communicated through design, she pursues a multi-disciplinary creative practice. She interrogates culture with her research-driven design practice that investigates how the designed world, especially new technology, is shaping our behaviour, perception and understanding.

## Secure UX Curriculum

The Secure UX Curriculum is a form of human rights centered design - design methodologies that combine human centered design with human rights policy. Human rights centered design is a response to the global abuse of people’s privacy and rights online: internet censorship, bias in technology, online harassment, adversarial state actors engaging in cyberwarfare and many other events that degrade or challenge general human rights. 

What are design principles and structures that put human rights first? Our curriculum is a set of guidelines organized into easy steps to help anyone working from ideation and research to development and deployment: researchers, designers, engineers, strategists, or writers who want to incorporate best practices into their workflows with design and privacy in mind. Even Facebook, historically uncommitted to protecting user privacy, mentioned at their 2019 F8 conference on how important privacy is, and how UX is paramount in creating usable, beautiful, and secure products. Design and privacy go hand in hand and this curriculum offers accessible ways to implement privacy from the ideation stage to prototype to final product. 

Inspired by leading-edge human rights principles and standards, IDEO's design kits, the Ethnography Field Guide, as well as others, our curriculum focuses on: research, ideation, prototyping, building, release and feedback. We will be spending the next year and a half writing, designing, and releasing it, and will be sharing our progress here. Do follow along!
