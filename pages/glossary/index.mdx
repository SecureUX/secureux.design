    Co-design

    chapter 4

    Co-design is about challenging the imbalance of
    power held within groups of individuals, who make important decisions about
    others lives, livelihoods and bodies. Often, with little to no involvement
    of the people who will be most impacted by those decisions. Co-design seeks
    to change that through building new relationships, capability and capacity
    for boundless curiosity. It uses inclusive convening to share knowledge and
    power.

    Persona Library

    chapter 1

    A persona library is a collection of different personas that design teams can use to help guide product development. However, we've noticed that persona libraries can contain out of date personas or are created in a general way to a different team than the team using the personas, which leads to the personas not being useful, or that representative of the actual users being researched. However, not all companies do this- but this is a recurring issue we've seen time and time again.

    Quantitative Research

    chapter 1

    Quantitative research is the process of collecting and analyzing numerical data. It can be used to find patterns and averages, make predictions, test causal relationships, and generalize results to wider populations.
Quantitative research is the opposite of qualitative research, which involves collecting and analyzing non-numerical data (e.g. text, video, or audio).
Quantitative research is widely used in the natural and social sciences: biology, chemistry, psychology, economics, sociology, marketing, etc.
