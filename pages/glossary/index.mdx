    co-design

    chapter 4

    Co-design is about challenging the imbalance of
    power held within groups of individuals, who make important decisions about
    others lives, livelihoods and bodies. Often, with little to no involvement
    of the people who will be most impacted by those decisions. Co-design seeks
    to change that through building new relationships, capability and capacity
    for boundless curiosity. It uses inclusive convening to share knowledge and
    power.
