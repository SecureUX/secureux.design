# Working with a community

## Working with communities and setting up secure communications

How you conduct research, design, and build with and for communities is one of the most foundational parts of human rights centered design. In this chapter we build on the environmental scan done in the previous chapter that helped determine the communities’ needs and capacity to address it. In an HRCD process, you should already be working with a community. This chapter focuses on safe and secure ways for you to collaborate with that community. HRCD isn’t just about the structure for doing work, it’s how you are doing that work, and how that work can accidentally or inadvertently harm collaborators, users, and community members you work with.

## Centering the community

It is essential that you have the full support of the community you are working with to understand their needs and capacity constraints, as well as get a well-rounded perspective of the problems you are trying to solve. This can be especially true if the problems or solutions have yet to be identified. Common mistakes at this time can be jumping into solutions without thoroughly learning those you are working with, where they need help, and how or whether your work will meet their needs. Too often, well-intentioned people with specific technical expertise have failed to effectively address a community’s problem, which may not need a technical solution who may be put at further risk by using that type of technology. It’s important to consider many factors before you even begin to work with the community.

### Step 1: Know your community

**Determine Whether or Not Your Community Trusts You**

- Relationship-building: Meeting people through trust circles
- Reputation / integrity
- Anonymous feedback loops surveys to understand who they want
- Consult with external organizations who specialize in equity to audit your work

## Working with your community through participatory research and localizing your project

The following outlines what you need to consider before you begin working on a project with your community. Localizing your work within the community’s context is a foundational first step. What this means is that you are taking language, cultural norms, and religious laws into consideration when working closely with these communities. Ideally, those working with these groups are from the community, though this is not always possible given needs that can be at odds with the resources of the communities.

If you are not from the community you are working with, it’s important to work closely with community leaders who can translate their needs and work in tandem with you throughout the entire research, design, development, and implementation processes. It is important that there is no room for misunderstandings or information loss between cultures and languages when you are designing products and services for these groups, so ensure that any surveys or other communications you are creating for them are vetted, localized, translated, adapted, and disseminated by a trusted community member.

## Meeting Your Community Where They Are

It’s crucial to use tools that are familiar to the community you are working with. One great example of how this works in the field is unpacked by Neema Iyer, design and research expert, and founder of the NGO, Policy. Neema explains, “So, one time we were trying to do focus group discussions with refugees in Kenya. And we were like, can we use zoom and then we realized no zoom is totally out of the picture. Because first of all, zoom is very data heavy. Also, if you've never used zoom, you don't know how to use it right, because you've just never had a reason to use it. So, we actually ended up running the focus groups over WhatsApp, because everybody knows how to use WhatsApp. And you can set up a WhatsApp group with eight people. And that actually worked out really well. Meeting people where they are on the platforms that they're at and then having these conversations with people from the community, or people who work with them in the community, to get to serve as their spokespeople and to give you feedback on whatever you're building.”

### Step 2: Setting Up a Secure Workflow with Your Community

We often say setting up communication and process within a group of people which means developing community support and acceptance in your work. It is the essential first step when working with communities, especially ‘at-risk communities’, to ensure you have built trust and have localized both your communications and processes to best communicate clearly with the communities you are working with. As an example, one way to localize your communications is to ensure that you are using communications technologies such as a messaging app that the community is familiar with. Or if you need to use an end to end encrypted chat application to ensure safety among conversations, that you are able to fully train the community on how to use it before going forward. In terms of localizing the process, you would want to ensure that you have a community advocate who can work with you to create a research and development process that is in the local language and respects the norms of that community. Another form of localization that will come later in our processes, will be ensuring that when you translate your work, you are using the correct kind of words that that community and their dialect uses and that your language or descriptions make sense to that community.

This is the essential first step when working with at-risk communities is to ensure you have built trust and have localized both your communications and processes to best communicate clearly with the communities you are working with. For example: one way to localize your communications is to ensure that you are using communications technologies such as messaging app’s that the community is familiar with, or if you need to use an end to end encrypted chat application, that you are able to fully train the community on how to use it before going forward. As far as localizing the process, you’d want to ensure that you have a community advocate who can work with you to create your research and development process in a way that is in the language and respects the norms of that community. Another form of localization that will come later in our processes, will be ensuring that when you translate whatever you’re working on, you are using the correct kind of words that that community and their dialect uses, and that your language or descriptions make sense to that community.

#### Case Study: From co-author, Natalie Cadranel, on conducting community based research and using ethnography as a tool for software production:

> “I am usually introduced to new communities who need support from colleagues; primarily through the library and archival science world that intersects with activism. Since these individuals come through a trusted network, I am able to work very closely with them and have immediate buy-in on the process including observing them in their environment in a regular day-to-day setting. For example, \*\*in 2011, three years before creating OpenArchive, I was working very closely with an Iranian refugee archivist to understand the challenges he faced when trying to preserve footage of the Green Movement. Due to repressive laws, he had to permanently leave his home and smuggle 30,000 hours of Green Movement footage out of Iran in order to preserve and disseminate it.Working with him encouraged me to start this work by deeply incorporating ethnographic research into the research process before even conceptualizing which tools needed to be built. From my perspective in the archival community, I know how important it is to preserve this media and, through my conversations with global archivists, I learned a lot more about the challenges in doing so when you're in a repressive region.
>
> After witnessing the ordeal he went through to preserve and amplify his local history, we discussed various ideas about how secure archival tools could potentially help other archivists mitigate surveillance and targeting in Iran so they would not have to leave permanently when trying to get the word out. Through his commitment to the project and our on-going discussions throughout the years, I was encouraged to do more ethnographic research with those who were having difficulty sharing, preserving, and amplifying their mobile phone documentation. I found that engaging him at every step of the research, ideation, and development processes was incredibly helpful for us to figure out which privacy and archiving technologies to prioritize when building our secure mobile archiving app that would become “Save” years later.
>
> My understanding of ethnographic research would be learning the perspective of the group you're serving including: what their needs are, where their problems stem from, and what their current capabilities are as far as technical knowledge or access to resources. And then being able to conceive of solutions that would fit well into their day to day functioning so you truly understand how they think, learn what works, what doesn’t, and know where blind spots may be (i.e. They think they know how to do X, but what are they actually doing in practice and is it causing an undesirable outcome?). So you really understand their process: you know who they are, what their motivations are, what their capacities are, and what they tell you their capacities are versus what they really are. You learn about the whole space from multiple perspectives through observation, interviews, qualitative and minimal quantitative research which can help inform your ethnographic study of that community to really understand what their challenges are.”

### Step 3: How to Center Human Rights with a Community Partner

**Defining a ‘Community Partner’ and What to Consider When Working Together**

Almost any group of people can be considered a ‘community’; a handful of friends, a mutual aid group with 1,000 members, a Discord server, a Facebook group, a neighborhood in a city, or a coalition of different activists could all be defined as different kinds of ‘communities.’ A community partner is a group that works to advise and support your work by sharing their lived experience'

Working with a community partner involves trust, nuance, and respect to create a safe, non-extractive relationship. It is important that both the creator and community partners have aligned, if not the same, goals in the process.

When working with a community partner, understanding their unique needs, threats, hopes, desires, identities, and concerns are your guideposts to helping them create a product or service while preventing harms they may face. As we mentioned in the first chapter, much of this will be done during the ecosystem mapping process.

**Open Source and Good Intentions Don’t Inherently Create Respect**

Respect, and equitable relationships are keys to centering human rights with your community partner. Not all nonprofits or volunteer run projects are doing ‘human rights’ or equity based work, and not all for-profits are bad. Context and how a project engages with community members and users and treats users is important. Some open source projects can have toxic communities or refuse to center practices to protect marginalized groups. For example, the founder of Linux often would “berate other Linux contributors, calling them names or hurling profanities, has also drawn criticism for creating a toxic environment and making the project unwelcoming to women, minorities, or other underrepresented groups.”

**Public Accountability is Key**

The Wikimedia community and related projects are a series of open source projects powered by volunteers and the educational nonprofit, the Wikimedia Foundation. Many often believe that because a product or group is based on open source methodology, it must be human rights focused. Our experience has showed that while open source communities are built on collaboration and diverse perspectives, their ethos of decentralization can cause harm among community members (Wikipedia included). While proving problematic for many tech-based communities in the past decade, a shining light has been the accountability that the communities and outsiders have held open source environments to.

By sharing processes for how technology is built and allowing for community input, it creates a kind of public audit which helps create trust; this kind of necessary transparency is fundamental to Wikimedia and other open source projects. Transparency and other forms of public accountability can be considered an audit that enables communities to have agency within the product building space; this kind of auditing and transparency that give communities more agency over the project is a part of the HRCD process.

A great example of public accountability and transparency are the processes the encrypted messaging app, ‘Signal’, uses which ensures the code is open source and viewable by anyone. This increases trust and enables community-lead auditing. Whereas, Telegram’s messaging app, whose encryption code is not shared, cannot be verified by the community, and becomes untrustworthy to the community it aims to serve. Signal shares their protocols and opens it up for others to test, see how it was written and audit the code.

With that being said, how do we replicate an accountability process with a community? We can take a slight open source ethos and apply it to participatory design. Nearly every step is shared with the community and opened up for feedback, and or conducted with the community. Bringing in the community to audit, review, reflect and connect with the product in deeper ways is reflected in them feeling more connected and safer using the product.

Bringing in community partners can look something like this:
Pose our question -> receive community feedback -> synthesize feedback and regroup -> publish new thoughts and a suggestion of where to go from feedback -> receive community input -> craft a research outline based on input -> start researching while community weighs in -> bring findings in small chunks quickly to the community -> receive community feedback -> pull design takeaways from community feedback and community -> start designing -> show initial wires to community and get feedback -> refine wires and initial design -> get more community feedback -> finalize and select wires for prototype -> community feedback -> test, test, test -> present findings from testing -> build

**Why do this kind of process?**

The process involves a lot of community reviews! That’s because working with a community is the best way to ensure you’re building something they’ll use and that’s made for them to use. There’s a joke in the design world that WIkipedia isn’t ‘designed’ well and text could be displayed in a more appealing, modern way. But Wikipedia does reflect the taste of those that view it. In doing on-going user research we discovered that editors of the text, often local community members who are volunteering to create pages, didn’t like a lot of white space when submitting information. Despite having always been taught in American design school systems to emphasize the design over the content, we had to appeal to our content-creators by continuously condensing the designs to allow for an easier submission process. By creating a process that worked for our authors, the site can increase its content regularly and remain a trusted source of information across a range of topics - despite not having a sophisticated design layout.

### Step 4: Understanding Security and Privacy When Working With a Community

Now that you’ve gotten community buy-in, assessed the technical capacities of that community, set up a workflow, and began centering human rights, it is time to ensure that you are protecting their rights when working with them. This means that you don’t want to inadvertently put them at risk of surveillance, doxxing, and other forms of harm online that can happen if communications are intercepted, insecure, or compromised in some other way.

#### Exercise 1: Assess How Secure your Communications Are

> Before you start building the tool, platform, or technology, you want to know the people who will be using them. Consider collecting and analyzing information from your stakeholders and research participants.
> User research involves many methods — interviews, ethnographic field research, focus groups, surveys, etc. [1] — that means you would retain information from others. It will be your job to protect them and their information. It will be your job to protect them and their information.
>
> Answer the following to gauge how you are doing:
>
> Communications and Information Gathering
> ☐ I have assessed the risks of how I am storing information from my research subjects in digital mediums (e.g., storing notes in cloud-based software, or on a hard drive). I store these notes in the following spaces **\*\*\*\***\_**\*\*\*\*** because **\*\*\*\***\_**\*\*\*\***
> ☐ The medium where I store my notes is relatively secure — it is end-to-end encrypted, and difficult for third parties to access (such as law enforcement requests).
> ☐ My research does not create a digital paper trail. (For instance, I consider how metadata, like the times we have contacted each other, can expose at-risk users.)
> ☐ If I have identifiable information about my participants, I have thought about where I will store this information. I have created a plan for keeping this information safe.
> ☐ I have a list of topics I should not ask my intended audience about.
> ☐ I know the kinds of topics I should keep off-record.
> Tips Comms and Info Gathering: [a] Partner with human rights organizations or have them as part of your research network. [b] Always use end-to-end encrypted channels when you can and find for your contact the best way to safely contact you. [c] Secure the data you keep and pay attention to protecting the identities of people in your research. [d] If metadata is a concern for your audience (e.g., having evidence of you and the contact chatting or calling), do you have an alternate method of communicating?
> Due Diligence
> ☐ I have a vetting plan and a trusted network to reach out for the vetting.
> ☐ If I keep documentation of my research process, I have considered the risks of keeping that information. (The same concerns in Communications and Information Gathering apply.)
>
> Due Diligence Tips:
> [a] Vetting subjects include the group you are helping, their biggest problem you want to solve, and the context. Find your measures of success, dealbreakers, and gather as much feedback as possible to ensure objectivity.
>
> Diversity and Inclusion
>
> - [ ] I use simple and jargon-free language to describe my project reviewed by my peers.
>       [ ] I work closely with someone — within the group that I am researching — to be mindful about their culture.
>       ☐ I always ask for consent. I remind people of safety and security concerns.
>       ☐ I keep a friendly, tolerant, and constructive space for feedback and opinions.
>
> Diversity and Inclusion Tips:
> [a] Always respect and consider diversity and inclusion in your process — tone, words, contact methods, etc.
> [b] Always be empathetic and considerate.
