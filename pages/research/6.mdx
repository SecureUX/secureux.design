# Personas

## Centering Human Rights When Creating Personas

This chapter is devoted to crafting ‘user personas’ and journey maps to help guide your project using a HRCD framework, while continuously centering and re-centering your community and their needs. The personas and maps are often used by designers or organizations to guide how your expected audience will use your products and service, and to understand their experience. Previous chapters on Research, Ecosystem Mapping and Centering Community are critical to a HRCD personas and user journey mapping, which will require you to use first hand experiences, community participation and buy-in, and research (qual, qant and desk research) to understand different users. Before we learn how to use personas, we need to understand what they are and the limitations that exist. 

A user persona is a write up of an anonymous user or series of anonymous users that is meant to mimic your actual users, their wants, their needs, how they use whatever you’re making, and how they are affected by your research questions. Sometimes a user persona is modeled after a particular person, but often they can be made up of fictional characters. For example, say you’re building a way for journalists to send encrypted messages and videos to each other. You would have a series of different user personas modeling journalists in various countries, with the unique type of harms they are facing, and their messaging habits. Additionally, you would want to make user personas of journalists across types of genders, devices, and levels of technology background. These personas can outline their personal and professional experiences, the issues that they face within a country or with their work, and general capabilities when using digital tools. Ideally, you will use the user personas to understand their motivations when using your product and how they will interact with it so you can design for the various people in your potential target audience. 

## The Strengths of User Personas

User personas are tools commonly used in design organizations, research organizations and engineering organizations. Personas are helpful in thinking through how specifically a ‘persona’ is often a presentation of a series of users with information gathered from user interviews. Personas can help ground research and ideation into how someone could or would use, misuse, understand or misunderstand what you are making.  For example, having a persona that uses Android, is on a 3G network, and often uses WhatsApp, helps remind you that your work needs to be Android and low bandwidth accessible. But, personas are only as useful as the research behind them. 

## The Criticism of User Personas

While personas are a helpful way to create a roadmap for your work and understand your potential audience, they can be challenging to create and often reproduce inequities. The [Design Justice](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-justice) book highlights how, more often than not, user personas are commonly created without doing the appropriate research. Without truly understanding who you are serving through deep ethnographic interviews and observations, you may unintentionally reinforce stereotypes. Sasha Costanza-Chock writes, “far too often user personas are created out of thin air by members of the design team (if not autogenerated by a service like Userforge), based on their own assumptions or stereotypes about groups of people who might occupy a very different location in the matrix of domination. When this happens, user personas are literally objectified assumptions about end users. In the worst case, these objectified assumptions then guide product development to fit stereotyped but unvalidated user needs. Sometimes, they may also help designers believe they are engaged in an inclusive design process, when in reality the personas are representations of designers’ unvalidated beliefs about marginalized or oppressed communities. Unsurprisingly, there are no studies that compare this approach to actually including diverse users on the design team.” Doing thorough research will shape how reflective your persona is to the real user it is embodying, and the decision making you will make based on it. 

As creators and researchers, we’ve seen these behaviors modeled throughout projects. Sometimes, a designer will pull out a persona from a persona library, and there will be little to no information on how that persona was made or how old it is which is critical information to understanding its validity. Moreover, the personas that are made available focus on surface level information such as a person's age, gender, race, and technical background of the user. These personas lack a lot of contextual information that would make a persona more useful to product mapping. Deeper level information could include the kind of threats a person would face, how they use technology, what their desires are for using something, and what frictions they encounter.

## Why Use Personas in an HRCD Process

Mapping out a user's needs is extremely helpful to truly understand a potential user's experience, especially when working with multiple team members and community members. It can allow you to gain a deeper understanding of the harms that come out of the problems you and the community have centered on or discovered. While we still advocate for the use of personas, the HRCD process reminds us that we must expand the existing definition of a persona and be careful to not condense or minimize it.

In comparison to the standard persona which can feel limited or prescribed, an HRCD-focused persona encourages a more involved process for creating robust personas that can only be achieved from real, in-depth qualitative and/or participatory research. Additionally, an HRCD persona also includes necessary information to help inform your work to make it as safe, secure, and intersectional as possible. You should be updating your personas every few years, timestamping it so you know when it was conceived or updated, and noting where the information was taken from or how it was used in other projects. It’s also encouraged to make new personas for different projects, as opposed to reusing them. You can use the older ones to compare or test how that persona would fit into your research, as a further method of threat modeling or testing, but an older persona should not be used in lieu of creating new personas.  

While HRCD personas can be helpful: sometimes, a person might be unable to vocalize their concerns or personal information. So, anonymizing this into a persona while sharing with other collaborators makes it a safer environment for their perspective to be brought into the decision making process while protecting their identity. 

Remember: personas are an iterative process. 
Throughout your research and design process, you can and should continuously go back and compare/contrast your personas with actual user flows throughout your projects and continue to iterate on them. Personas can guide you throughout your process, and develop as new research, changes or events occur. Much like how real life and research continues onward, your personas should evolve and iterate over time. 

Often in the design process,  you can stop and ask how would Persona A use this tool or respond to this situation? This will help ground your team and community in the nuances of the project, while reflecting on use cases and complexities within your project. 

## Putting Personas into Practice

Imagine you were building a secure and encrypted messaging tool for journalists that provides a safer alternative to WhatsApp. Given your global potential audience, it's important to ensure that the app is accessible, usable, and works on the devices your intended audience uses. A persona can be helpful in a practical sense to help prioritize which platform to focus on. Personas help remind you of those real world constraints, and also help you document and build up necessary internal information about why you’re building something, and the needs of who you’re building with. While it can be tempting to start building an app that works only on Apple’s iOS software, it will be useless to the global community who uses Android and a 3G network.

#### Case Study 1: Natalie Cadranel, Founder & Executive Director, OpenArchive

> A real world example is described by Natalie in her time working with Human Rights Watch (HRW). HRW intakes various forms of human rights documentation from the field to help survivors bring accountability and justice to their perpetrators, develop advocacy and outreach campaigns, and build evidentiary archives for the communities they work with.  To create personas for this use case, they identify the people and stakeholders that are receiving the media from the field. This includes looking at the kinds of media people were receiving and sending, like survivor interviews, videos, images, and firsthand documentation. From there, pulling directly from many user interviews, the team crafted four personas: the researcher, the archivists, the videographer, and the technologist - the different kinds of people receiving or interacting with the media they had identified. Next, to better understand the problem from these four specific perspectives, the team created a venn diagram of overlapping needs, wants and security harms to better see the extent of this research area. Because the team was focusing on security harms and gaps, they created journeys for their personas that allowed them to compare and contrast the real world harms with the ideal use cases. This comparison allowed them to see where the products and tools fell short, and how to change or improve those tools. For example, one of the personas wanted the ability to send video over WiFi but the videographer persona didn’t always have WiFi which showcased the challenges of sharing videos with Human Rights Watch. Thus, an app that worked over WiFi would negatively impact the videographer and their ability to share videos with the organization, which is their primary means of media sharing. These kinds of exercises gave the Human Rights Watch team a lot of needed information on various users' challenges to create journey maps to better see how the user personas are collecting media, documenting them, and sharing that media.

#### Case Study 2: Kimberly Seals Allers, Founder of Irth

> The following is an excerpt of a conversation between Kimberly and Caroline. Irth is a social change tool designed to address the high mortality and the infant mortality crisis among black mothers in the US, which results from racism and bias in care. Irth is a Yelp-like review and rating platform for black and brown women and birthing people to find and leave reviews of their OB-GYNs, birthing hospitals, postpartum experiences, as well as their pediatric care for up to baby's first year, to bring accountability and transparency to the medical system.

>
> **Caroline:**
> 
> One thing I would love is, if you don't mind sharing tips for people on how to build with communities or how you found the different communities you were working with in different cities, and any suggestions for people on how to really build that relationship with communities?
> 
> **Kimberly:**
> 
> Yeah. So, two things that are really clear, you have to start with the right framework. And this is the lead slide on all of my presentations that I did in my birth and breastfeeding work, which is, whatever the question, the answer is in the community. And so, if you don't believe that the community holds the answers too many times, we feel like we're trying to help and save a community. And I always felt like the community could save itself and I'm trying to give it a tool. And that's a whole different way of, it's not like you're trying to save the community, that's the wrong idea. You are actually leveraging. For me, Irth is a tool to leverage the power that's already in the community for it to now be a digital platform, so the community is literally saving itself. So that is something that's critically important, whatever the question, the answer is in the community. It's not in the research or medical journals. It's not there. It's in the community. So, what are you doing to be in touch with the community?
> 
> The other thing that I would say, tip number two is stretch yourself. When people try to test an idea on the Black people that they know, the Brown people they know, the Indigenous people that they know, that is always a fail. You have to be willing to get to know the people that you claim to serve. It sounds really simple, but very few people are doing this correctly. And be respectful, don't tokenize people. I get calls from many white design teams, white tech companies, that all of a sudden are very interested in black maternal health. They have no history of doing this work. They have no history of caring about this issue, but all of a sudden, they care, and they want to bring on a black person to help them tap into this market and provide them [access].
> 
> It took a lot more work for me to be on the ground in New Orleans, listening to people, standing out in front of churches, putting up a tent in Walmart parking lot, going to hair salons and nail salons and standing in strip malls. It's a hell of a lot of work. I mean, quite frankly, people don't want to put in the work, but you gotta put in the work. So be willing to put in the extra work. It is not going to be as simple as a focus group. And you have to be willing to put in the work. So that's an important part of understanding how we can build a different co-design process.
> 
> And when people are saying that something needs to change, you actually have to listen. There were lots of things that I thought… would be a good idea and no one else thought it would be a good idea. But listening to the community is a whole other thing, that you take the pieces that you want and discard the other bits, but to truly listen, to truly listen, I think is the other part that's really, really important.

#### Exercise 1: Creating the HRCD Persona

> Usually persona development is done with a group of people, not alone in isolation and not by one person. A way to start is to bring together your community members and part of your team. Together, you can start by developing a persona using demographic information to describe the persona. Be as descriptive and intersectional as possible. Remember, the point is to make them as real as possible. A good way to start is by identifying various groups of people that can be grouped into a set of personas, for example, at Human Rights Watch, we identified three main groups of people who need a better secure mobile application that will help them preserve field media while also protecting all involved. Natalie chose to focus on the three groups as they were central to the work of collecting and preserving evidentiary media: Videographers in the field collecting survivor testimonies and other evidentiary documentation, The Archivist working to intake, keep organized, and make the media accessible to those who need it, and….

> Here is a template you can use to map out your personas: [https://cacoo.com/assets/site/img/templates/screenshots/persona-template@2x.png](https://cacoo.com/assets/site/img/templates/screenshots/persona-template@2x.png)
> 
> * A pseudonym (this will make easier to refer to the persona in conversations with your group) 
> * Age
> * Location
> * Education 
> * Occupation 
> * Race
> * Gender 
> * Sexuality 
> * Religion
> * Disabilities 
> 
> Then tell us about the persona:
> * What do they like to do?
> * What is their relationship like with their family or peers?
> * What are their goals?
> * What motivates them?
> 
> To get a level deeper, we use the HRCD frame to ask the following questions: How does the persona relate or fit into your problem statement? For example, if you’re researching something related to technology, how do they use the technology? Why do they use technology in a particular way? This is a space for you to confront your own assumptions, as well. 
> 
> Include these additional questions in the persona:
> * What are their desires and wants, in relation to your problem statement?
> * What do they dislike, or what does not work well for them?
>   * If you’re building something, have there been previous failures and why? 
> * What do they need? (Again, what do the community members say they need, not what YOU think they need) 
> * What are the real world constraints they face, focusing on burdens and frictions the user is facing, focusing on time, ability and emotional labor required? 
>   * This is probably the hardest one to describe, because it relates so specifically to your user group. For example, when researching online harassment, a lot of potential tools or workflows place a high amount of burden on the user when that user is already in an emotionally heightened space. Facing harassment is extremely stressful. Trying to file a harassment report or find security settings that are buried deep within an app can further stress out the user. Requiring the user to file a police report may be extremely untenable and inappropriate for that user; after all, the police are not safe authorities for many users to engage with. But also, leaving one’s house, and filing a report takes time a user may not have. This section is asking you and your community to reflect back on what are all the burdens and friction a user may have in regard to what the area or problem is you’re focusing on 
> * What are the real world constraints they face, focusing on technology and tools? 
>   * Internet connectivity issues
>   * Electricity issues 
>   * Apps often not localized in their language 
> * What are the real world constraints they face, focused on human rights?
>   * This could be living in a country that has censorship on the media or internet censorship, a country with laws against being queer, etc. 
>   * List out every single kind of harm or constraint, related to intersectionality and human rights, that come to mind 

#### Exercise 2: Comparing Ideal Use Cases versus Actual Use Cases from Your Personas 

>The goal of this exercise is to compare an ideal scenario in your community using or engaging with the project to the reality and frictions that you’ve found within your research. However, we need to heavily caveat this section. In a non HRCD process, this exercise can be flattened, made shallow and reflect real world stereotypes. Don’t do that and use real research. Let’s use the Human Rights Watch example from the text. 
>
>For example: you may not be able to reconcile the actual personas with the ideal personas, but you can make contingency plans for what they can do if your tool/process doesn't cover their need (like if they have no good wifi, they can send hard drives in the mail).
>
>In Natalie’s work, she was researching how people share first hand media back to other institutions, using four personas that included the archivist, researcher, videographer and technologist. Though it was outlined that “large media files shared over WiFi” is the ideal use case, it was challenged by the idea that “WiFi is not always available.” This kind of mapping and listing let’s see you see where security and privacy issues may occur and why.
>
>[venn diagram where one circle says ‘the ideal: use case and usage’ and another says ‘the reality: frictions and barriers’], and the middle where they converge.
>
>Use this venn diagram to map out your ideal and realistic personas to understand potential barriers your personas will face in your project.

#### Exercise 3: Outlining Harms and Threats 

> This exercise is related to the HRCD framing but goes a bit more in-depth and is more specific to your personas and your particular project. Outline the harms and threats faced by your community by answering these questions:
> 
> * Are there key historical, or cultural contexts and facts we need to know? 
>   * This can be highlighting regional specific bias or histories of harms
>   * How do they impact the community's behavior? 
> * Are there any harms they face specifically tied to their identity? 
>   * Go through the basic information list and map it out. Some users will face harm depending upon where they live based on their occupation, gender, religion, sexuality, or all of the above overlapping.
> * What are the harms they face online or in technology? How do these harms transfer outside of digital spaces?
>   * This could be similar to the above, but a chance to get more specific. Maybe someone is an activist who faces coordinated harassment campaigns, related to their work or their gender. Maybe those harassment campaigns come from different governments or from everyday people. Those harms of: harassment related to activism, harassment related to gender, harassment FROM their fellow country people, harassment FROM other governments, are four points that should be listed out. 
> * What harms do they face offline? 
>   * This might simply be sharing the human rights issues at hand but share how it specifically impacts that person. Has someone mentioned any offline or physical threats? Maybe it’s difficult for them to travel or get a visa, etc. 

#### Exercise 4: Creating a Web of Relational Issues

> This exercise focuses on how to link together different personas that face different but related harms. It's also a way to understand how a potential harm can impact personas differently. Once you’ve created the personas, you can start to group them around problem areas. Problem areas are points in the workflow where the persona may be put in harm’s way, or there are frictions around access to technology, unfamiliarity with the tools or processes being introduced, or ways that the work may violate cultural norms. You can start identifying the problem areas by asking yourself the questions below. This can be done by printing out the personas and using markers, post it notes, or even string, to group them together around thematic issues , specific kinds of harm, or the kinds of apps or technology used. Those thematic issues or harms or tech used all can be listed out on separate post it notes or pieces of paper so you can better see the landscape of issues facing your personas. 
> 
> Ask yourself: 
> * How are the harms different between personas?
> * What is the cultural context of the problem we are asking and of our users? How do we know?
> * What are the security threats, both online and offline? 
> * What are the most important needs we need to center? How do we know? 
>   * Get feedback on listing these needs from the community and a presentative from each user persona group
> * What harms are related to things we can change (maybe nothing can change! Maybe it’s adding a better security feature or something privacy related), and cannot change (laws, policy, bias, etc.)? 
>* What are opportunities? 
>   * This can be an area to ideate and work with your community. You can start listing out ideas to present back to more community members and use this as a jumping off point for ideating.
