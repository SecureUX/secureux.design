Because first of all, zoom is very data heavy. Also, if you\u2019ve never used zoom, you don\u2019t know how to use it right, because you\u2019ve just never had a reason to use it. So we actually ended up running the focus groups over WhatsApp, because everybody knows how to use WhatsApp. And you can set up a whatsapp group with eight people. And that actually worked out really well.
