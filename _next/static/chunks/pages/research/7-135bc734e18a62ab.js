And that's where I think technology is so important. Circle of 6 was made in pre-social media or right around the beginning of socials, but it was about strengthening already existing relationships, knowing that young people, from what I heard from users, she was the first person they talk to after an assault at each other, as your friends. So how can we make sure your friends have good information? Because that was the other thing that happened during my screening. People would come up to me and say, \"my friend, my this, my that, I don't know how to help them.\" And I would say, \"Make sure you have resources.\" There are some links we love, listen to and then gently provide them with options."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"I wanted to make sure that people understanding that the information could be helpful, not vigilantes, not rape deniers. Then you could reach out to your people and get help with the geolocation, which wasn't the most popular feature. It was the feature that all the media got really excited about because they still have the narrative that someone's going to swoop in and rescue you. Because to them, it's always stranger danger, which is not really the case. But the second one is \u2018call and interrupt me\u2019 and that is really useful in terms of harassment or just needing to get out of a situation and not quite having the language or the reason for the phone call interruptions. That feature also really translated globally in the street harassment context in India and other places."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And the third one is the one that was the most used. When we surveyed students at a few colleges that one was the most used because it would say, I need to talk. And then everyone in your group would know it was a shorthand for something. So it's also a way to say it without saying it, which I think was really important. It was really groundbreaking. It's like, I'm going to acknowledge that. Something uncomfortable or potentially really bad happened. I don't want to name it. I don't know if I can name it, but it relates to this subject because it's coming through this app. So that was really powerful. I did not predict that."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Those are the features like for me, I wanted it to be sex positive, sex positive is not the right word, but just not this bullshit stranger danger around every corner lurks a terrible experience. All of these safety apps really take away people's urgency in my mind and also have a tendency to have victim blaming marketing. So it was the other thing I was really clear about is like, whatever little thoughts we make or language we use, no one's ever going to ask the question, \"Why was this girl at a party till 4:00 AM?\" It's because that's how everyone parties when they're in college and beyond."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"So that's a given you're out having a good time, that is a given. You're out doing whatever you want. It's absolutely your right. And you should just be connected to your friends. So I was just trying to use a harm reduction model to meet people where they are. That\u2019s really the ethos. I mean, the code base is not extraordinary, sleek, complicated. It's just like adding the layer, gender and safety with empowerment and going out and being safe and being connected is your right. We just want you to have fun and do it as simply as you want or need."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,o.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"On Understanding When Your App Can\u2019t Work For All Related User groups"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"I think we were trying to do too much in a way, because intimate partner violence and coercion and solutions to that are just different than more incidents like sexual violence. So it was like, I don't think we can marry these two very upsetting phenomena because they're actually quite different. I talked to people in the DV (domestic violence) community about building our safety planning tools for safety planning and getting out of violent relationships. And the base is similar. You have your people that you check in with, but the tools are different. So we learn we can't really marry those two things. You can just strengthen existing relationships and provide useful resources, so that was that."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Additionally, we spent a lot of time talking to the sex worker community, we sketched out a bad date app idea with another group in San Francisco, which could have been cool then, it didn't happen ultimately."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,o.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Nancy\u2019s Advice For Building Social Good Technology for Communities"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Designing will definitely be in conversation, I guess really what's always helpful. Is your limitations like, who are you designing for? Are you part of this community or people that are part of the community on your team? Are you in dialogue? We had an advisory board and you don't want to get steered at like 1,000 directions either. Your tool can only do what it can do. You're going to get a lot of feedback. And then at some point you just have to pull back and be like, okay, really this tool can only do one thing. It can't do everything for everyone. So if you do have to eventually make decisions about what you're trying to impact and just make sure that before you begin to solve someone else's problem, really think about why you're trying to do this. And if you are not officially part of the community you're designing for, make sure you have community buy-in, make sure it's useful. Don't assume people need something unless you have proof that they do."}),"\n"]})]})};return r?(0,o.jsx)(r,Object.assign({},e,{children:(0,o.jsx)(t,{})})):t()}},1151:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.d(t,{ah:function(){return a},Zo:function(){return r}});var o=n(7294);const i=o.createContext({});function a(e){const t=o.useContext(i);return o.useMemo((()=>"function"===typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}),[t,e])}const s={};function r({components:e,children:t,disableParentContext:n}){let r=a(e);return n&&(r=e||s),o.createElement(i.Provider,{value:r},t)}}},function(e){e.O(0,[774,888,179],(function(){return t=1091,e(e.s=t);var t}));var t=e.O();_N_E=t}]);
