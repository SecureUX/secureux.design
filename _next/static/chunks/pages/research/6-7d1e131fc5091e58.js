Sasha Costanza-Chock writes, \u201cfar too often user personas are created out of thin air by members of the design team (if not autogenerated by a service like Userforge), based on their own assumptions or stereotypes about groups of people who might occupy a very different location in the matrix of domination. When this happens, user personas are literally objectified assumptions about end users. In the worst case, these objectified assumptions then guide product development to fit stereotyped but unvalidated user needs. Sometimes, they may also help designers believe they are engaged in an inclusive design process, when in reality the personas are representations of designers\u2019 unvalidated beliefs about marginalized or oppressed communities.

Moreover, the personas that are made available focus on surface level information such as a person's age, gender, race, and technical background of the user.

To create personas for this use case, they identify the people and stakeholders that are receiving the media from the field. This includes looking at the kinds of media people were receiving and sending, like survivor interviews, videos, images, and firsthand documentation. From there, pulling directly from many user interviews, the team crafted four personas: the researcher, the archivists, the videographer, and the technologist - the different kinds of people receiving or interacting with the media they had identified. Next, to better understand the problem from these four specific perspectives, the team created a venn diagram of overlapping needs, wants and security harms to better see the extent of this research area. Because the team was focusing on security harms and gaps, they created journeys for their personas that allowed them to compare and contrast the real world harms with the ideal use cases. This comparison allowed them to see where the products and tools fell short, and how to change or improve those tools. For example, one of the personas wanted the ability to send video over WiFi but the videographer persona didn\u2019t always have WiFi which showcased the challenges of sharing videos with Human Rights Watch. Thus, an app that worked over WiFi would negatively impact the videographer and their ability to share videos with the organization, which is their primary means of media sharing.
