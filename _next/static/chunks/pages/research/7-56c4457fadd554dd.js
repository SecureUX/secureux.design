Because first of all, zoom is very data heavy. Also, if you\u2019ve never used zoom, you don\u2019t know how to use it right, because you\u2019ve just never had a reason to use it. So we actually ended up running the focus groups over WhatsApp, because everybody knows how to use WhatsApp. And you can set up a whatsapp group with eight people. And that actually worked out really well. Meeting people where they are on the platforms that they\u2019re at and then having these conversations with people from the community, or people who work with them in the community, to get to serve as their spokespeople and to give you feedback on whatever you\u2019re building.\u201d"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(o.h3,{children:"Step II: Setting up a workflow with your community"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(o.p,{children:"One of our co-writers, Caroline, used to work with the Wikimedia Foundation, an open source1, educational nonprofit that powers Wikipedia.
