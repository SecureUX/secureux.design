So it was like, I don't think we can marry these two very upsetting phenomena because they're actually quite different. I talked to people in the DV (domestic violence) community about building our safety planning tools for safety planning and getting out of violent relationships. And the base is similar. You have your people that you check in with, but the tools are different. So we learn we can't really marry those two things. You can just strengthen existing relationships and provide useful resources, so that was that."]}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Additionally, we spent a lot of time talking to the sex worker community, we sketched out a bad date app idea with another group in San Francisco, which could have been cool then, it didn't happen ultimately."}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(t.p,{children:[(0,o.jsx)(t.strong,{children:(0,o.jsx)(t.em,{children:"Nancy’s Advice For Building Social Good Technology for Communities"})}),"\nDesigning will definitely be in conversation. I guess really what's always helpful is your limitations like, who are you designing for? Are you part of this community or people that are part of the community on your team? Are you in dialogue? We had an advisory board and you don't want to get steered in like 1,000 directions either. Your tool can only do what it can do. You're going to get a lot of feedback, and then at some point you just have to pull back and be like, okay, really this tool can only do one thing. It can't do everything for everyone. So if you do have to eventually make decisions about what you're trying to impact and just make sure that before you begin to solve someone else's problem, really think about why you're trying to do this. And if you are not officially part of the community you're designing for, make sure you have community buy-in, make sure it's useful.
