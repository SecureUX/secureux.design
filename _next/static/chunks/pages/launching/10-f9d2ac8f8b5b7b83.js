It\u2019s imperative to create a consistent space to place the update and explain the changes you\u2019ve made, why you made these changes, and how they changed the technology. Being able to contextualize the update is a vital component of the HRCD process. It creates a channel of communication that allows community members the ability to provide feedback outside of user testing and product ideation to share how the changes will impact them. To practice meaningful and HRCD informed transparency, users and community members must be treated as active participants in the post-launch process. Therefore, you have to create a place where community members can offer feedback and engage with the changes you\u2019ve made. It is helpful to have a dedicated space on your website or platform that is easy to find and not buried among the site's contents.

Others might explicitly describe the update via GitHub or mobile app store updates.

To appropriately share updates with your community, it is recommended to use a variety of mediums. This means to share across blog posts, social media, email, notification on the platform, coding platforms, app store updates, messaging services or wherever else you have a presence. The key is to create an open channel of communication between you and the community. This two-way dialogue enables the community to comment and add feedback to the changes you\u2019ve made, while allowing you to respond directly to their needs and suggestions."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Also, important to note are the communications channels that were set up with the community during the research and development process.
